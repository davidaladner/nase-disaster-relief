      <p>While working physically in the field may not be possible for all who would like to serve, there are plenty of ways to help out the recovery effort.</p>
      <Title level={5}>At the Command Center</Title>
      <ul>
        <li>Help at command center administrative tables (if needed)</li>
        <li>Prepare food for those working to staff the command center. If this has been assigned, there may be room for some to assist</li>
        <li>Provide snacks for those at the command center, teams leaving to work in the field, and those camping.</li>
        <li>Help provide an evening meal for all workers when they return (likely Saturday). This could provide a service opportunity for many people who enjoy cooking for others and could be coordinated by a person or small committee.</li>
        <li>Man shifts to help the supply yard staff. Help pass out supplies to teams, welcome those driving in, empty trash cans all around the building and near toilet/shower facilities as needed, etc.</li>
        <li>Have a runner for supplies to deliver extra supplies to teams in the field if they run out or have an unexpected need. This may not be feasible if workers are spread over a large geographic area but could be very helpful if workers are near the command center.</li>
      </ul>
      <Title level={5}>From Home/Outside of the Command Center</Title>
      <ul>
        <li>Pray for and with those affected by the disaster</li>
        <li>Become a phone volunteer for Crisis Cleanup</li>
        <li>Donate to the Church's humanitarian fund</li>
        <li>Help fund those who can physically work with water, snacks, gas for travel, etc.</li>
        <li>Babysit so those with children can help. This is especially appreciated by younger mothers who often don't get to do the hands-on work outside of their own home.</li>
        <li>Check on neighbors and share crisis cleanup information</li>
        <li>Offer encouragement to those affected by disaster</li>
        <li>Help with laundry of those affected by disaster</li>
        <li>Share electricity with neighbors if you have it and they don't</li>
        <li>Write short notes of encouragement, love, and hope for teams to take to those they help</li>
        <li>Help fill in callings on Sunday for those that are working in the field</li>
        <li>Have a Communications person for a team - they could confirm work needed, set up possible times, visit with the homeowner while the work is done, report work and needs back to the command center. In some teams this could be a full load that could free up the rest of the team to work and decrease dead ends. In some cases, the main task may be to build bonds with the homeowners.</li>
        <li>By Priesthood assignment, make calls inviting families to volunteer. Help identify teams they can join with if needed.</li>
      </ul>
