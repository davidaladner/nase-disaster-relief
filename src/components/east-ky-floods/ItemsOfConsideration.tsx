        <strong>Safety &amp; Skills.</strong>
        If a work team receives a work order or requrest to provide services that are beyond their skill set, appears to be unsafe, or just doesn't feel right, then please return that work order uncompleted.
        We are an unskilled volunteer workforce providing basic labor and moral support.
        <strong>There is no expectation that we undertake hazardous or specialized work.</strong>&nbsp;
        <strong>Ladders</strong> are needed for tarp jobs. Remembers to <em>hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.</em>

        <strong>Ministering.</strong>
        At least one member of the team should interface with the people we are helping, not to proselyte, but to offer comfort and hope and a message from the Savior.
        They will ask you who you are and where you come from.
        We have found it a good experience to offer to pray with the family and the work team as part of the process. Take pictures and video if appropriate. Ask for permission.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Work as a team.</strong>
        Be unified. Before arriving at the Command Center, organize the work teams of 8 or 9 members each, but no more than 10 people. Each team should have an assigned leader.
